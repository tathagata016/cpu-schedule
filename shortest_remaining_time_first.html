    <h1>Shortest Remaining Time First Scheduling Algorithm:</h1>
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is the preemptive version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm, where the processor
            is allocated to the job closest to completion.
            <br/><br/>
            This algorithm requires advanced concept and knowledge of CPU time required to process the job in an interactive system,
            and hence canâ€™t be implemented there. But, in a batch system where it is desirable to give preference to short jobs, SRT
            algorithm is used.
            <br/><br/>
            However, SRT involves more overheads than SJN, as the OS is required to frequently monitor the CPU time of the jobs in
            the READY queue and perform context switching.
